## Project Proposal

### Proposal Baseline Checklist

Before submitting, check whether your proposal clearly covers these points:

- [ ] Clear problem definition and why it matters for MoFA
- [ ] Concrete technical design (modules, interfaces, data flow)
- [ ] Executable timeline with measurable milestones
- [ ] Risks and fallback plan (what you will do if Plan A slips)
- [ ] Evidence of execution before selection (PRs, design docs, prototypes, or benchmarks)
- [ ] Testing and validation plan
- [ ] Realistic weekly time commitment and communication plan

### Abstract (10 lines max)

Summarize:
- The problem you're solving
- Current state of the art
- Your proposed solution

### Motivation

- Why does this project excite you?
- What do you hope to learn?
- How does this fit your career goals?
- What does success look like for you?

### Technical Approach

#### Understanding
Demonstrate you've explored the codebase:
- Key files/modules you'll work with
- Technical challenges you anticipate
- Questions you still have

#### Implementation Plan
Outline your approach:
- High-level architecture decisions
- Key algorithms or data structures
- External libraries or tools you'll use
- Fallback plans if your primary approach fails

### Schedule of Deliverables

Use the GSoC timeline as your reference. Break down your work into phases:

#### Pre-GSoC (Before acceptance)
- [ ] Build and run MoFA locally
- [ ] Read relevant documentation
- [ ] Discuss approach with mentors
- [ ] Draft proposal iterations

#### Community Bonding Period
- [ ] Get to know mentors and community
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Make first contribution (small fix or documentation)
- [ ] Refine project plan based on feedback

#### Phase 1 (First half)
- Week 1-2: [Learning Rust/Makepad, understanding codebase]
- Week 3: [Specific milestone]
- Week 4: [Specific milestone]
- Week 5: [Specific milestone]
- Week 6: Mid-term evaluation

#### Phase 2 (Second half)
- Week 7: [Specific milestone]
- Week 8: [Specific milestone]
- Week 9: [Specific milestone]
- Week 10: [Testing, documentation]
- Week 11: [Demo preparation, final polish]
- Week 12: Final submission

### Expected Outcomes

List concrete deliverables:
- Code contributions (features, bug fixes)
- Documentation (user guides, API docs)
- Tests (unit tests, integration tests)
- Demo or video showcasing your work

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| [e.g., Learning Rust takes longer than expected] | Medium | Allocate buffer time in Weeks 1-3 |
| | | |

## Additional Information

### Availability

- Hours per week you can commit:
- Any conflicts (exams, travel, other work) during GSoC period:

### Post-GSoC

How do you plan to stay involved with MoFA after GSoC ends?
