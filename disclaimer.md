## A Quick Note for GSoC Candidates

First of all, thank you — sincerely.

Every member of the MoFA team genuinely feels the enthusiasm and energy you bring to GSoC and the MoFA project. Whether it’s idea discussions, thoughtful conversations, documentation improvements, proposal drafts, or early code contributions, we truly value them all and deeply appreciate the time and effort you’ve invested.

At the same time, we’d like to clarify a few important points:

- **Please understand and follow the GSoC rules (and understand that we must ensure fairness for everyone).**
  Be sure to carefully read and comply with the official GSoC rules and timeline.
- **We cannot make any decisions in advance.**
  As a participating organization, MoFA must strictly follow GSoC’s official policies, evaluation process, and schedule.
- **At this stage, we cannot provide formal evaluations.**
  Out of genuine appreciation and respect, we will do our best—when possible—to provide feedback and suggestions on your ideas or proposal drafts. However, this feedback should not be interpreted as an official endorsement or guarantee of acceptance. Final decisions will be made in accordance with GSoC’s evaluation criteria, organizational slot allocations, and a comprehensive review by the MoFA evaluation team (including mentors, org admins, and invited experts).
- **Beyond GSoC.**
  We will do our best to provide meaningful guidance. Regardless of the GSoC outcome, MoFA remains an open-source community, and you are always welcome to continue building with us. We also hope to create and share other opportunities with you in the future.

Thank you again for your passion and professionalism. You are truly impressive — many of you have exceeded our expectations. It is our honor to collaborate with you.

— MoFA Team
